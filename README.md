# Real Estate "Rent a Property" Web App

This is a Single Page Real Estate "Rent a Property" web app implemented in React. The app allows users to filter properties based on various criteria and add properties to their favorites list.

## Features

1. **Filtering Mechanism**: The app provides 4 levels of filtering, allowing users to filter properties based on their location, type, price, and size. The app displays results that satisfy all the filters.

2. **Favorites Page**: Users can add a specific property to their favorites page. The design of the favorites page is not provided in the reference, so it has been created as per the theme using imagination.

3. **Dummy Data**: The app uses dummy data to display results after applying filters. The data is sufficient to provide a good user experience.

4. **Third Party CSS Library**: The app uses Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework, to style its components.
